<h1>Lists in Kotlin</h1>

<p>A list is a collection of items with a specific order. There are two types of lists in Kotlin:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="">Read-only list</a>: List cannot be modified after you create it.</li>
    <li><a href="">Mutable lis</a>t: MutableList can be modified after you create it, meaning you can add, remove, or update its elements.</li>
</ol>
