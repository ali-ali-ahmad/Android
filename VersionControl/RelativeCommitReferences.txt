Relative Commit References
You already know that you can reference commits by their SHA, by tags, branches, and the special HEAD pointer. Sometimes that's not enough, though. There will be times when you'll want to reference a commit relative to another commit. For example, there will be times where you'll want to tell Git about the commit that's one before the current commit...or two before the current commit. There are special characters called "Ancestry References" that we can use to tell Git about these relative references. Those characters are:

^ – indicates the parent commit
~ – indicates the first parent commit
Here's how we can refer to previous commits:

the parent commit – the following indicate the parent commit of the current commit
HEAD^
HEAD~
HEAD~1
the grandparent commit – the following indicate the grandparent commit of the current commit
HEAD^^
HEAD~2
the great-grandparent commit – the following indicate the great-grandparent commit of the current commit
HEAD^^^
HEAD~3
The main difference between the ^ and the ~ is when a commit is created from a merge. A merge commit has two parents. With a merge commit, the ^ reference is used to indicate the first parent of the commit while ^2 indicates the second parent. The first parent is the branch you were on when you ran git merge while the second parent is the branch that was merged in.
